# Assignment 2:
In this assignment we finetune and evaluate a transformer pre trained model based on Tripadvisor dataset. The purpose of our developed model is to predict the tokenized semantic data and predict future classification for the same dataset using Bert_Based_Cased model.

We worked together in a group of three consisting of Esben Graahede, Frederik Lauritzen and Mathias Juul. We sat down and worked together, so there are not any particular parts that one person spearheaded.

We were supposed to write down which parts of the assignment provided us with the most difficulty…. Honestly it was the process of finding a dataset and preprocessing it to fit the requirements of the method we used.

The notebook is named “Portfolio_Assignment_2_Classification_Tripadvisor” and it is divided into 6 parts: Importing packages and pip installs, Prep the dataset, Training/tuning, Evaluating, Download the model, & Using the model through Huggingface
