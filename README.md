# Portfolio-Deep-Learning-Artificial-Intelligence

Assignment 1:
Hello and welcome to an analysis of the stock development of Apple Inc. This repository aims to analyse different deep learning subjects through similar approaches in the hopes of discovering underlying and embedded patterns in the listed data. 

We worked together in a group of three consisting of Esben Graahede, Frederik Lauritzen and Mathias Juul. We sat down and worked together, so there are not any particular parts that one person spearheaded.

The first assignment notebook is named “Portfolio Assignment1: RNN AAPL.py”. It is divided into 9 steps:

Feature Selection
Feature Engineering
Data Preprocessing
Train-Test (or Train-Validation-Test) Split
Define Your Neural Network Architecture in PyTorch
Training Loop
Hyperparameter Experiments
Model Evaluation
Documentation & Discussion

Through these 9 steps the process of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is described and executed.


Assignment 2:

In this assignment we finetune and evaluate a transformer pre trained model based on Tripadvisor dataset. The purpose of our developed model is to predict the tokenized semantic data and predict future classification for the same dataset using Bert_Based_Cased model.

We were supposed to write down which parts of the assignment provided us with the most difficulty…. Honestly it was the process of finding a dataset and preprocessing it to fit the requirements of the method we used.

The notebook is named “Classification_Tripadvisor” and it is divided into 6 parts:
Importing packages and pip installs
Prep the dataset
Training/tuning
Evaluating
Download the model
Using the model through Huggingface
