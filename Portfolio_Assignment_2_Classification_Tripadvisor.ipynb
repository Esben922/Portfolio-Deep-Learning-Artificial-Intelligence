We called in morn and asked for late check out. Was \"transferred\" to appropriate person - only to be made to wait for ten minutes on hold listening to music. We knew they werent sold out so an extra hour or two would have been helpful. The attitude was remarkable. Finally - they did us a huge \"favour\" and allowed us check out until 1 pm instead of noon! Upon leaving with stroller and 2 suitcases - none o fthe staff could be bothered to assist. Our brand new stroller got crushed in their ridiculous front revolving door. We looked for help and finally one of their bellboys slowly sauntered over while we were tugging at stroller to free it. This cannot be a 4.5 - 5 star hotel. The service/attitude was horrrendous.

        "This calculation shows that our model captures 50.3% of the possible improvement space between random and perfect classification. However, the tendency to misclassify ratings that are close in value (e.g., 3-star vs. 4-star) suggests difficulties in capturing subtle sentiment differences, a common challenge in multi-class sentiment classification.\n",
        "To better understand our model’s performance, we considered alternative approaches. Traditional machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest provide better interpretability but struggle with contextual understanding. These models rely on hand-crafted features like TF-IDF or word embeddings, which often fail to capture the complexity of natural language sentiment. While they can be useful for simpler classification tasks, they generally underperform compared to transformer-based architectures in nuanced sentiment analysis.\n",
        "Other deep learning approaches, such as LSTMs and CNNs, offer an alternative to transformers but require significantly more data to achieve similar performance. Recurrent networks like LSTMs are designed to handle sequential text data, yet they struggle with long-range dependencies compared to BERT. Convolutional models, while effective for feature extraction, often fail to grasp the sequential nature of text in the same way transformers do.\n",
        "Within the transformer family, DistilBERT and RoBERTa present interesting alternatives. DistilBERT, a lighter version of BERT, achieves similar performance with lower computational cost, making it a viable alternative for efficiency-focused applications. RoBERTa, an improved version of BERT trained with optimized pretraining strategies, often outperforms BERT in classification tasks and could potentially yield better results on this dataset.\n",
        "Overall, our BERT-based model performs moderately well, outperforming traditional ML models and offering better generalization than LSTMs or CNNs given our dataset size. However, its accuracy remains below the ideal threshold for reliable review classification. The primary limitation stems from the small dataset size (400 reviews for training), which restricts the model’s ability to learn nuanced sentiment patterns. To enhance performance, data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and alternative transformer architectures could be explored to push accuracy toward the 70-80% range, making the model more robust for real-world rating prediction."
